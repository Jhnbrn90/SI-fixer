A solution of ethyl 2-[bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phosphoryl]propanoate (1.5 g, 4.33 mmol, 1.1 equiv) and 18-crown-6 (5.2 g, 19.7 mmol, 5.0 equiv) in THF (100 mL) was cooled to -78 °C after which a 1 M solution of KHMDS in THF (4.0 mL, 4.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min. at -78 °C and a solution of 2,3-O-cyclohexylidene-D-glyceraldehyde (804 mg, 4.73 mmol, 1.2 equiv) in THF (5 mL) was added dropwise at -78 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at -78 °C, after which the reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of a sat. aq. NH4Cl solution. The reaction mixture was extracted with Et2O (3x) and the combined organic phases were dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified by silica gel column chromatography (1%5% EtOAc/cHex), providing the title compound as a colorless oil in 58% yield (590 mg, 2.32 mmol).
